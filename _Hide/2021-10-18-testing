Let's see what we can do here.

## Video  
Let's put a [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvdACvfuGFA). And its actual link <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvdACvfuGFA>

## Image  
Let's then put a image here.

![an image alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E28kwrtVUAY5B-V.jpg "image here")

Don't know why this doesn't work. Let's try a different one.

And what about a gif, can it work

### Text
Now let's try typing something.
Will this cause a line break?
Or only this  
We'll see.

I'm a bit **hugry** right now because I didn't have my _lunch_, because `the kitchen is a disgusting mess caused by my roomates who never clean up and it's so digusting that I didn't wanna get in`.


#### Cheatsheet  

Let's put a cheatsheet here for future reference. <https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet>
