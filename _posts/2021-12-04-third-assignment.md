title: Expedition to the Poetry Archive
---

On entering the website, one can see the name of The Poetry Archive and a single-line description informing that this is **a website for poetry appreciation featuring the voice of poets**. Below the title is a search bar for one to find a specific poet or poem by name; or alternatively, one can chose “Start exploring the archive” to be taken to **an explore page** which is also equipped with a search bar with filter function as well as **some recommended collections**. 

One can also explore more by scrolling down the main page, which also has **a recommended collection of 20 winning poets in 2021, the audios of 4 recommended poets in a row reading one of their own works, and some recommendations to the newly added collections**.

**I don’t think the website is ideal for doing research**, because it does not offer the background in which a poem is written, and the information about the poet on the poet’s page is considerably limited. Also, it does not organize the works of a poet systematically, nor provide key words search in the transcriptions of the poems. While it does attach tags to poems and poets for categorization, they do not quite facilitate research, but rather exploration of poetry enthusiasts.

Apart from the exploration functions mentioned above, there are also **a few more features the website has for better experience of poetry appreciation**. For example, the “distraction free mode” that can be turned on next to every audio play bar, and the tags attached to every poem that can introduce the interested readers to more works of similar themes.
