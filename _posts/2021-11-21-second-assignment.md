title: Expedition to Hansard

## Layout and Functionality
The Hansard website consists of a brief introduction and a **search bar** in the header and two columns of House of Commons and House of Lords as the body. In both of the columns, there are a link to the record of the latest sitting and other four viewing options: **browse sittings**, **find debates**, **find divisions**, and **find MPs/Lords**. On clicking ‘browse sittings’, one can get to a page with a calendar on the left showing days with content and the whole debates on a specific date chosen on the right. In other three viewing options, one can modify a variety of filters including keywords, house, and date range; and can see the reference counts of a chosen keyword across a time span of the most recent five years.

## Possible Researches
One can do research on the **changes in the procedure of debate** in the **‘browse sittings’** section by modifying the date, comparing the procedure of today with that of decades or even a century earlier. The whole debates divided into sections shown on the right gives a clear vision of that. One can also research on the **gender or ethnicity composition of the house across time** by going to the **‘find MPs/Lords’** section, where one can modify the time span and see the members in service during that time; and also click into the page of a chosen member to see their contribution in order to evaluate if his/her participation has been effective. Also, if one wishes to conduct **discourse analysis**, it would be more efficient to use the **search bar** in the main page. It would show results of all the debates in which the keyword has been referred to and would also show the text of the debate with the keyword highlighted, which would facilitate research on a specific topic.
