## Afterthougts of National History Museum Virtual Visit

&nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as the page was loaded, I decided on the Fantastic Beasts exhibition because, not unexpectedly, I’m a Harry Potter fan.  
  
&nbsp; &nbsp;I was very excited about the first few pages when I found out that the pictures were panoramic and I could move them around as if physically being there and seeing things through my own eyes.
  
&nbsp; &nbsp;But  soon I encountered many **blurred images**, possibly done out of copyright protection or some other reasons _(as shown in image1)_. Also, the pictures **couldn’t be zoomed in**, making it difficult, sometimes impossible, to read the descriptions. Even if you forcibly zoomed in with screenshots or other functions, some of the words were still unreadable _(as shown in image2)_. As a result, you can only get a general sense about the exhibits without really knowing what they are about or even what they are.

&nbsp; &nbsp;I only realized that this exhibit was probably not for free after I finished the whole tour and went back to the beginning to find out about the “Free for Members” sign in the second pictures. Therefore, the purpose of this online exhibit may be to attract people to visit the museum offline. If this is the case, then it has largely accomplished the task. 
  
&nbsp; &nbsp;Overall, I would say that the online exhibition is interesting and worth visiting, and I quite appreciate the effort of linking the demonstration of fictional fantastic beast to the introduction of real-life endangered species.  Although, I do think there are possible improvement to be made. For example, it could consider taking advantage of the **technology applied in Google Maps street view** *(as shown in image3)* to make the spatial order more apparent and the visitor experience more engaging.
